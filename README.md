# MLF-Project
 Writing a Script to construct and test a ML (Machine Learning) model for the scenario.

Scenario:
Health Promotion Board is looking for ways to maximize their outreach program to increase peopleâ€™s awareness about Stroke. You are tasked to construct a ML model to identify people who are more vulnerable to Stroke using the dataset.

The script should do the following:
1. Use appropriate library to read the CSV file.
2. Remove the following types of data from the dataset:
     Invalid data,
     Null values,
     Unknown values
3. Convert categorical columns to numeric values.
4. Choose the appropriate columns from the dataset as feature columns.
5. Choose the appropriate column from the dataset as the target column.
6. Choose at least 2 appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting the binary target.
7. Select training data and test data from the dataset.
8. Perform the necessary pre-processing on the training and test data from step 7.
9. Train the machine learning models using the selected algorithms and training data.
10. Use the selected test data to evaluate the models.
11. Select appropriate metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the models.
12. Demonstrate the accuracy of each model using the selected metrics and determine the most suitable model.
