# ML-Project
A Script that I have written to construct and test Machine learning models for the scenario. 
 
 *P.S Theres a guide i wrote when i did the project you can use it if you are a student or someone doing a similar project to mine :)*

Scenario:
Health Promotion Board is looking for ways to maximize their outreach program to increase peopleâ€™s awareness about Stroke. You are tasked to construct a ML model to identify people who are more vulnerable to Stroke using the dataset.
